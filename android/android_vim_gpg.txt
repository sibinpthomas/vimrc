* Installed DroidVim. Purchased git and curl on app.
* Simplified vimrc for Android. Modified it to handle Linux path separators and Android folder structure (Vim_Files).
* Created Vim_Files folder in top level phone memory.
* Downloaded and installed plugins via Vundle.
* DroidVim doesn't support gpg.
* Installed Termux app.
* In Termux installed packages gpg and other relevant ones.
* Execute 'termux-setup-storage'. See -
    https://termux.com/storage.html
    https://android.stackexchange.com/a/166637
* Used same vimrc as DroidVim with path to Vim_Files changed since Termux sees the directory structure differently (see links above).
* Everything worked smoothly from here on. Plugins were recognized by Termux Vim. The GPG plugin worked, and on creation of a .gpg file a widget to ask for password popped up...Success!

TODO -
* See how vim_backup settings should be handled with GPG usage.
* Need to play around with vim textwidth setting to see what is right for phone screen.
